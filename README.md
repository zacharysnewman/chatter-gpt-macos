- The "Chatter" app will show up in your tray at the top of the screen
- Dictation must be enabled or it will silently fail. (System Settings > Keyboard > Dictation)
- You should be prompted for Microphone access
- If you go into "Setup" and click "Speech Recognition" you should be prompted for Speech Recognition access (Note: This button won't go away until you close and restart the Chatter app)
- Make sure to fill out the API Key with your API Key from OpenAI
- Feel free to name your AI anything you want, but remember that the speech recognition system may transcribe some names incorrectly
- Click "Start Listening" once you've completed the Setup to get started
- Remember to say your AI's name anywhere in your sentence to activate it
- In my experience it can take anywhere from 2-6 seconds to return a response (could depend on internet speed or length/complexity of the query)
